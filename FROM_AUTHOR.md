#Foreword
I am still determining what this series will bring. For now, it will be a series of my and others’ failures. 
I'll hide myself and the others behind Gretha, whose events lead to a Junior Software Engineer position. It's unexpected, as she was trained to be a Quality Engineer before that. 
The truth will be mixed with fantasy, mainly in the characters’ relationships. All bugs and mistakes did happen. This is based on a true story!
### Why write something like that?
The overall message is "you're not alone,” as when I started my IT journey, I was overwhelmed by several factors:
- the number of things I did not know
- the number of things that happened to be "useful at some point"
- the number of times I read or heard that it’s “quick.”
- the number of times I heard it’s “easy” and “simple.”

I think the last point was the one that screwed me over the most. I can not count how many times I have read a sentence that made no sense to me. Rereading it several times also did not help. Then *the drumroll* enters the scene - panic mode! Suddenly I found myself deep in the valley of “I am not good enough.”
This whole piece will live its own life; feel free to report issues if you do not understand something or spot inconsistencies; I’m all ears 

**PS**
I included a License.md on this piece to prevent commercial use of the original work. You can distribute the original and modify it. Still, while doing that, you must include copyright, state changes made, and give credit to the original author, which, oh well… is me, kruczyna. I understand it’s pretty contradictory to what GitHub stands for; I might revisit the license later. For now, it’s my and others’ blood and sweat, so I feel protective.
